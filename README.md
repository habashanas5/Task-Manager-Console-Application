# Task Manager Application

## Overview
The Task Manager application allows you to manage tasks effectively by adding, updating, deleting, and viewing tasks. It also provides features like searching for tasks, viewing task progress, and saving/loading tasks from a file.

## Features

1. **Add a Task**  
   Create new tasks with the following details:
   - Title
   - Description
   - Due Date
   - Priority
   - Status
   - Category

2. **View Tasks**  
   Display tasks, filtered by category (optional), and sorted by due date.

3. **Update a Task**  
   Modify an existing taskâ€™s details such as:
   - Description
   - Due Date
   - Priority
   - Status
   - Category

4. **Delete a Task**  
   Remove a task based on its title.

5. **Search Tasks**  
   Find tasks that match a given keyword in the title or description.

6. **View Progress**  
   Check the completion rate of tasks to see how many tasks are completed versus those that are pending.

   Persist tasks in a JSON file (`tasks.json`), allowing data to be saved and loaded between sessions. This ensures that tasks are available even after the application is closed and reopened.
